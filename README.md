# 🎨 React Native Color Game

A playful, minimalist React Native game where users enter their name and get a randomly selected color revealed to them in a fun, interactive way. It's a great intro app for learning `useState`, user interaction, and styling in React Native!

- 🎨 Tap a button to reveal a randomly selected color (with the screen changing to match!).
